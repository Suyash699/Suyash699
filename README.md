A web developer, specializing in web technologies such as Javascript and its frameworks, HTML, CSS, etc.

I have 2.8 years of experience as an application administrator/support personnel at a reputed IT firm.

But as I was fascinated with the world of development, I decided to switch to web development.

Till now, I have been only creating projects and gaining experience! Kindly connect if you have any suggestions/projects for me!
